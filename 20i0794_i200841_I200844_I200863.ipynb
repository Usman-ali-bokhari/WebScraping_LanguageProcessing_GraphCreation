The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.More DetailsPhD (Software Engineering)Admission ProcessApplication FormThe PhD program requires candidates to undertake a number of graduate level courses, pass a qualifying examination, and then carry out research in a chosen area.

Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups.

The program is designed to discover management scholarship which is intellectually rigorous, morally intensive, socially integrative, culturally relevant and globally acknowledged. PhD scholars will be encouraged to carry out original work through research which connects strongly with resolving local, national and global challenges of significance. PhD in Management is offered at Islamabad at Lahore Campus.The Islamabad Campus is currently offering PhD in the following areas of specialization: ManagementFinanceHuman Resource ManagementTechnology ManagementEligibilityA Master’s degree in a relevant subject, earned from a recognized university after a minimum of 18 years of education with CGPA of at least 3.0/4.0 or equiva lent.A minimum of 60% marks and at least 50 percentile rank in the relevant NTS subject test. The NTS GAT-Subject Score should be valid at the time of admission.Selection CriteriaAdmission is based on a candidate’s performance in the following:Performance in International GMAT or an equivalent test as per HEC ruleInterview and assessment by the Doctoral Admissions Committee (FSM DAC)Submission of Research Proposal (for the purpose of evaluation)Scheme of StudyThe PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.More DetailsPhD (Software Engineering)Admission ProcessApplication FormThe PhD program requires candidates to undertake a number of graduate level courses, pass a qualifying examination, and then carry out research in a chosen area.

The program is designed to discover management scholarship which is intellectually rigorous, morally intensive, socially integrative, culturally relevant and globally acknowledged. PhD scholars will be encouraged to carry out original work through research which connects strongly with resolving local, national and global challenges of significance. PhD in Management is offered at Islamabad at Lahore Campus.The Islamabad Campus is currently offering PhD in the following areas of specialization: ManagementFinanceHuman Resource ManagementTechnology ManagementEligibilityA Master’s degree in a relevant subject, earned from a recognized university after a minimum of 18 years of education with CGPA of at least 3.0/4.0 or equiva lent.A minimum of 60% marks and at least 50 percentile rank in the relevant NTS subject test. The NTS GAT-Subject Score should be valid at the time of admission.Selection CriteriaAdmission is based on a candidate’s performance in the following:Performance in International GMAT or an equivalent test as per HEC ruleInterview and assessment by the Doctoral Admissions Committee (FSM DAC)Submission of Research Proposal (for the purpose of evaluation)Scheme of StudyThe PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.More DetailsPhD (Software Engineering)Admission ProcessApplication FormThe PhD program requires candidates to undertake a number of graduate level courses, pass a qualifying examination, and then carry out research in a chosen area.

The program is designed to discover management scholarship which is intellectually rigorous, morally intensive, socially integrative, culturally relevant and globally acknowledged. PhD scholars will be encouraged to carry out original work through research which connects strongly with resolving local, national and global challenges of significance. PhD in Management is offered at Islamabad at Lahore Campus.The Islamabad Campus is currently offering PhD in the following areas of specialization: ManagementFinanceHuman Resource ManagementTechnology ManagementEligibilityA Master’s degree in a relevant subject, earned from a recognized university after a minimum of 18 years of education with CGPA of at least 3.0/4.0 or equiva lent.A minimum of 60% marks and at least 50 percentile rank in the relevant NTS subject test. The NTS GAT-Subject Score should be valid at the time of admission.Selection CriteriaAdmission is based on a candidate’s performance in the following:Performance in International GMAT or an equivalent test as per HEC ruleInterview and assessment by the Doctoral Admissions Committee (FSM DAC)Submission of Research Proposal (for the purpose of evaluation)Scheme of StudyThe PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.More DetailsPhD (Software Engineering)Admission ProcessApplication FormThe PhD program requires candidates to undertake a number of graduate level courses, pass a qualifying examination, and then carry out research in a chosen area.

Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.More DetailsPhD (Software Engineering)Admission ProcessApplication FormThe PhD program requires candidates to undertake a number of graduate level courses, pass a qualifying examination, and then carry out research in a chosen area.

Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups.

The program is designed to discover management scholarship which is intellectually rigorous, morally intensive, socially integrative, culturally relevant and globally acknowledged. PhD scholars will be encouraged to carry out original work through research which connects strongly with resolving local, national and global challenges of significance. PhD in Management is offered at Islamabad at Lahore Campus.The Islamabad Campus is currently offering PhD in the following areas of specialization: ManagementFinanceHuman Resource ManagementTechnology ManagementEligibilityA Master’s degree in a relevant subject, earned from a recognized university after a minimum of 18 years of education with CGPA of at least 3.0/4.0 or equiva lent.A minimum of 60% marks and at least 50 percentile rank in the relevant NTS subject test. The NTS GAT-Subject Score should be valid at the time of admission.Selection CriteriaAdmission is based on a candidate’s performance in the following:Performance in International GMAT or an equivalent test as per HEC ruleInterview and assessment by the Doctoral Admissions Committee (FSM DAC)Submission of Research Proposal (for the purpose of evaluation)Scheme of StudyThe PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.More DetailsPhD (Software Engineering)Admission ProcessApplication FormThe PhD program requires candidates to undertake a number of graduate level courses, pass a qualifying examination, and then carry out research in a chosen area.

The program is designed to discover management scholarship which is intellectually rigorous, morally intensive, socially integrative, culturally relevant and globally acknowledged. PhD scholars will be encouraged to carry out original work through research which connects strongly with resolving local, national and global challenges of significance. PhD in Management is offered at Islamabad at Lahore Campus.The Islamabad Campus is currently offering PhD in the following areas of specialization: ManagementFinanceHuman Resource ManagementTechnology ManagementEligibilityA Master’s degree in a relevant subject, earned from a recognized university after a minimum of 18 years of education with CGPA of at least 3.0/4.0 or equiva lent.A minimum of 60% marks and at least 50 percentile rank in the relevant NTS subject test. The NTS GAT-Subject Score should be valid at the time of admission.Selection CriteriaAdmission is based on a candidate’s performance in the following:Performance in International GMAT or an equivalent test as per HEC ruleInterview and assessment by the Doctoral Admissions Committee (FSM DAC)Submission of Research Proposal (for the purpose of evaluation)Scheme of StudyThe PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.More Details', 'PhD (Management Sciences)Admission ProcessApplication FormProgram OverviewThe PhD program provides high quality management education to business scholars i.e. to discover and impart culturally and globally relevant knowledge in management sciences.

The NTS GAT-Subject Score should be valid at the time of admission.Selection CriteriaAdmission is based on a candidate’s performance in the following:Performance in International GMAT or an equivalent test as per HEC ruleInterview and assessment by the Doctoral Admissions Committee (FSM DAC)Submission of Research Proposal (for the purpose of evaluation)Scheme of StudyThe PhD program requires candidates to take six graduate level courses (18 Cr. hrs.). There are four core courses, listed below. The remaining two can be taken from graduate level courses in the Faculty of Management Sciences or from the specialization electives for PhDs with the recommendation of the supervisor. On completion of the coursework, students are required to pass a qualifying comprehensive examination, defend their research proposal and then carry out research in the chosen area. The candidates are also required to publish research papers in journals of international repute, as per prevalent requirements.List of Core CoursesTitleCr. hrs.TitleCr. hrs.Philosophy of Management Science3Quantitative Methods in Management Research 3Research and Theory in Management3Qualitative Methods in Management Research3Note: Deficiency courses may be recommended by FSM-DAC for selected candidates on case to case basis.Outlines of Core Courses (These are broad guidelines only. Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fit)Philosophy of Management Science (MG601): It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority. This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy. Accordingly, the process that will be used will start with, and put major focus on, developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management. The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – i.e., perspectives such as classical and neo-classical organization theory, OB perspective, structural organization theory, systems theory and organizational economics, power and politics, organizational culture and environment, and postmodernism, etc. – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing, predicting, controlling and governing human action.Research and Theory in Management (MG604): A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances. But where do new theories come from? How theories are built starting from a very basic research question? And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction. Finally, what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory? The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building. Topics include examining the nature of being (ontology) and knowing (epistemology), exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence, developing a pertinent and interesting research question, defining constructs, imagining relationships and processes that link constructs, and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models. This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom, research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished, and a term paper be completed.Qualitative Methods (MG 589): This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods. Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether \"true\" knowledge or reality can exist, the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research. Examples of topics covered include interviews, focus groups, ethnography, documentary and textual analysis, discourse analysis, language and conversation analysis, case-studies, participatory action research and grounded theory. Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail. The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis. The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era. Further, scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papers.Quantitative Methods (MG 548): This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis. Building on the positivist paradigm, the course will briefly revise concepts of probability, sampling, hypothesis development, developing constructs, associations and basic analyses for differences between groups. Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression, discriminant analysis, MANOVA, analysis of covariance, principal component and factor analysis, cluster analysis, structural equation modelling, survival/failure analysis and time series analysis. The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis. Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods, developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questions.More Details', 'PhD (Management Sciences)Admission ProcessApplication FormProgram OverviewThe PhD program provides high quality management education to business scholars i.e. to discover and impart culturally and globally relevant knowledge in management sciences.

motivated the founders of SBASSE to establish the School of Science and Engineering at LUMS to bring a paradigm shift in science and engineering education in the countryThe LUMS Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering SBASSE initiated in 2008 is the first private research school for science and engineering in Pakistan with a vision“to carry out worldclass multidisciplinary education and research” Modelled on some of the leading universities of the world it aims to be a paradigm shift for science and engineering education in the country  The concept of “no boundaries” education and interdisciplinary research is a key strength and a pillar of SBASSE Highquality science and engineering education are at the heart of our vision and we are strongly committed to continually evolve our unique common core curriculum in line with the latest trends at top international research universities The school intends to increase emphasis on continuous improvement of teaching pedagogy and curricular modernization as well as recognition and acknowledgement of good teaching Further strengthening the driving philosophy of “no boundaries” the school intends to effectively engage with other schools at LUMS to create opportunities for transdisciplinary teaching and research Our School’s vision is exemplified by some of the crosscutting themespursued in our Departments and research groups

MGSHSS enjoys a strong reputation of academic excellence especially with its Departments of Social Science and Economics considered as the strongest in Pakistan Focusing on a multidisciplinary approach so that students study a mix of wide ranging courses the SHSS imparts longserving and highquality liberal arts education touching on philosophy sociology anthropology and literature among others The MGSHSS has contributed greatly to the countrys repertoire of superior multidisciplinary education in the liberal arts The faculty at MGSHSS holds impressive credentials from leading international universities and includes acclaimed experts and scholars with significant publications to their credit Many members of the faculty continue to advance within their respective research interests The school was originally known as the School of Arts and Sciences in 2006 it took on the title of SHSS School of Humanities and Social Sciences when there was a shift of some science disciplines into the new School of Science and Engineering After the first batch of Law students graduated from the School in 2008 the school title was revised to the School of Humanities Social Sciences and Law MGSHSS In 2012 the school was renamed as Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani School of Humanities and Social Sciences MGSHSS to honour the contributions and generosity of Mr Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani and the Gurmani Foundation to education in Pakistan and to LUMS in particular By the next three years the University will establish a separate School of Law During this time the current Department of Law and Policy will continue to operate as part of the MGSHSS The MGSHSS growth at LUMS is directly linked to the thriving of social sciences in Pakistan where once there was a dearth of interest in social sciences at higher levels of educationThis was taken up as a challenge by the MGSHSS and education at the School carefully evolved Individual disciplines were grouped together under the umbrella of one school instead of being branched into different departments allowing for varied disciplines such as philosophy and psychology to work together when offered as interdisciplinary courses Exposure to studies at the MGSHSS has led to many students developing a deep interest in the social sciences and several have opted to pursue their PhDs in liberal arts Some graduates have gone on to serve as faculty members at LUMS and credible universities in other parts of theworldafter completing their doctoral degrees The schools curriculum is rooted in the original design of the Universitys undergraduate curriculum which aimed to include a strong liberal arts component initially called universal education Although LUMS began its undergraduate programme by offering majors in Economics and Computer Sciences this eventually led to an offering in Social Sciences as a separate major The curriculum has been carefully designed and developed over the years by the faculty at LUMS in conjunction with feedback from distinguished faculty from international universities   DHA Lahore Cantt 54792Lahore Pakistan Phone 92 42 3560 8000  Fax 92 42 3572 5048\n"

see fitPhilosophy of Management Science MG601 It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy Accordingly the process that will be used will start with and put major focus on developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – ie perspectives such as classical and neoclassical organization theory OB perspective structural organization theory systems theory and organizational economics power and politics organizational culture and environment and postmodernism etc – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist paradigm the course will briefly revise concepts of probability sampling hypothesis development developing constructs associations and basic analyses for differences between groups Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression discriminant analysis MANOVA analysis of covariance principal component and factor analysis cluster analysis structural equation modelling survivalfailure analysis and time series analysis The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questionsMore

see fitPhilosophy of Management Science MG601 It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy Accordingly the process that will be used will start with and put major focus on developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – ie perspectives such as classical and neoclassical organization theory OB perspective structural organization theory systems theory and organizational economics power and politics organizational culture and environment and postmodernism etc – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist paradigm the course will briefly revise concepts of probability sampling hypothesis development developing constructs associations and basic analyses for differences between groups Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression discriminant analysis MANOVA analysis of covariance principal component and factor analysis cluster analysis structural equation modelling survivalfailure analysis and time series analysis The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questionsMore

see fitPhilosophy of Management Science MG601 It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy Accordingly the process that will be used will start with and put major focus on developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – ie perspectives such as classical and neoclassical organization theory OB perspective structural organization theory systems theory and organizational economics power and politics organizational culture and environment and postmodernism etc – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist paradigm the course will briefly revise concepts of probability sampling hypothesis development developing constructs associations and basic analyses for differences between groups Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression discriminant analysis MANOVA analysis of covariance principal component and factor analysis cluster analysis structural equation modelling survivalfailure analysis and time series analysis The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis Scholars

selected candidates on case to case basisOutlines of Core Courses These are broad guidelines only Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fitPhilosophy of Management Science MG601 It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy Accordingly the process that will be used will start with and put major focus on developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – ie perspectives such as classical and neoclassical organization theory OB perspective structural organization theory systems theory and organizational economics power and politics organizational culture and environment and postmodernism etc – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist paradigm the course will briefly revise concepts of probability sampling hypothesis development developing constructs associations and basic analyses for differences between groups Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression discriminant analysis MANOVA analysis of covariance principal component and factor analysis cluster analysis structural equation modelling survivalfailure analysis and time series analysis The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questionsMore

organizational culture and environment and postmodernism etc – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist

Core Courses These are broad guidelines only Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fitPhilosophy of Management Science MG601 It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy Accordingly the process that will be used will start with and put major focus on developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – ie perspectives such as classical and neoclassical organization theory OB perspective structural organization theory systems theory and organizational economics power and politics organizational culture and environment and postmodernism etc – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist paradigm the course will briefly revise concepts of probability sampling hypothesis development developing constructs associations and basic analyses for differences between groups Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression discriminant analysis MANOVA analysis of covariance principal component and factor analysis cluster analysis structural equation modelling survivalfailure analysis and time series analysis The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which

Core Courses These are broad guidelines only Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fitPhilosophy of Management Science MG601 It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy Accordingly the process that will be used will start with and put major focus on developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – ie perspectives such as classical and neoclassical organization theory OB perspective structural organization theory systems theory and organizational economics power and politics organizational culture and environment and postmodernism etc – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist paradigm the course will briefly revise concepts of probability sampling hypothesis development developing constructs associations and basic analyses for differences between groups Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression discriminant analysis MANOVA analysis of covariance principal component and factor analysis cluster analysis structural equation modelling survivalfailure analysis and time series analysis The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questionsMore DetailsPhD Software EngineeringAdmission ProcessApplication

Core Courses These are broad guidelines only Instructors may vary emphases on individual topics and themes and bring additional topics that they see fitPhilosophy of Management Science MG601 It is said that management is governing and leading without recourse to political power or religious authority This advanced level course will help students to realize and appreciate the nature of management field to a greater maturity and sophistication by interchangeably addressing the philosophical aspects of management and managerial aspects of philosophy Accordingly the process that will be used will start with and put major focus on developing an understanding of the evolution of management and organizational philosophy in a chronological order by classifying the work of central theorists and authors from a perspective that clarifies their relevance with the mainstream theory building in the field of management The idea is to dissect the body of knowledge in management science – ie perspectives such as classical and neoclassical organization theory OB perspective structural organization theory systems theory and organizational economics power and politics organizational culture and environment and postmodernism etc – and interpret it as a continuous effort to analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist paradigm the course will briefly revise concepts of probability sampling hypothesis development developing constructs associations and basic analyses for differences between groups Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression discriminant analysis MANOVA analysis of covariance principal component and factor analysis cluster analysis structural equation modelling survivalfailure analysis and time series analysis The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data analysis Scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand articles which have used a variety of quantitative methods developing the capacity to choose advance techniques suitable for their research questionsMore DetailsPhD Software EngineeringAdmission ProcessApplication

analyzing predicting controlling and governing human actionResearch and Theory in Management MG604 A theory is said to be an ordered set of assertions about a generic set of behavior that hold true for a wide range of specific instances But where do new theories come from How theories are built starting from a very basic research question And can theories be good or bad since once popularized they not only explain behavior but influence behavior in a certain direction Finally what constitutes a ‘weak’ or a ‘strong’ theory The aim of this course is to develop a critical appreciation ofthe role of research in theory development in Management as well as introducing doctoral students to the art and science of theory construction and model building Topics include examining the nature of being ontology and knowing epistemology exploring the basic structure of argument and evidence developing a pertinent and interesting research question defining constructs imagining relationships and processes that link constructs and linking and combining constructs in an innovative way to develop new theories or build further upon existing behavioral models This course demands intensive preparation on part of students in terms of readings prior to the lectures so that lively discussions can be generated in the classroom research exercises tailored to each student’s research topic can be accomplished and a term paper be completedQualitative Methods MG 589 This course will introduce a range of qualitative research methods and the means of assessing the key assumptions underlying the selection and use these methods Building on the fundamental questions about the nature of knowledge and whether true knowledge or reality can exist the discussions will provide a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges in carrying out qualitative research Examples of topics covered include interviews focus groups ethnography documentary and textual analysis discourse analysis language and conversation analysis casestudies participatory action research and grounded theory Categorization and coding of data will be covered in detail The course will include labs to introduce software for qualitative data analysis The course will also cover the growing significance of qualitative research techniques across the modern and postmodern era Further scholars will be encouraged to analyze and understand various approaches to writing qualitative papersQuantitative Methods MG 548 This course will introduce a range of advance quantitative research technique and develop an understanding of the potential and limitations of statistical analysis Building on the positivist paradigm the course will briefly revise concepts of probability sampling hypothesis development developing constructs associations and basic analyses for differences between groups Examples of main topics covered include various types of regression discriminant analysis MANOVA analysis of covariance principal component and factor analysis cluster analysis structural equation modelling survivalfailure analysis and time series analysis The course will include labs to introduce software for quantitative data
